**FAQ:**

- **How do these food delivery apps work?**
  All of these apps are simple to use: you enter an address, browse or search for a restaurant or item, and place an order. The app then dispatches a nearby courier (driver or rider) to pick up your food and deliver it to you. You can typically track the delivery status live and get notifications when your order arrives.

- **Are there ways to save on delivery fees?**
  Yes. Many apps offer monthly subscriptions (like DashPass, Uber One, Deliveroo Plus, etc.) that give free or reduced delivery fees for a flat monthly rate – great if you order often. Also look out for promo codes, first-time user discounts, or loyalty programs (for example, SkipTheDishes rewards) which can cut costs. Choosing pickup instead of delivery, when convenient, is another way to save the fee entirely.

- **Do these services deliver only restaurant food?**
  Not anymore. While originally focused on restaurant takeout, many of these platforms now deliver groceries, convenience store items, alcohol, and more. For instance, Instacart is purely grocery-focused, Uber Eats and DoorDash have grocery and convenience sections, and Gopuff specializes in snacks and essentials. You can satisfy both your meal cravings and shopping needs through a single app in many cases.
